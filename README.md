# Haiku Checker

#### By **Samantha Callie**

#### Check your haiku

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Webpack
* Jest

## Description

This site allows users to check whether their haiku follow the proper rules. It very often gets the answer wildly wrong because I couldn't get a syllable library working.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repository
* In a command line console, navigate to the top level of the directory and run the command `npm i` (requires npm)
* Then after everything has installed, run `npm run build`
* Navigate to the newly-generated scr directory and open index.html
* Alternately, you can run `npm run start` and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to serve the project live

## Known Bugs

* There are no known bugs at this time
